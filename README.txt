*** PLANCAKE ANDROID APP ***

This is the code of the Plancake Android app as it is on the Android Market:
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.plancake.android.app

In order to use this source code, you need to get an API key here:
http://www.plancake.com/api-documentation

Once you have an API Key, you need to update the
plancake_api_key
and
plancake_api_secret
parameters in the res/values/plancake_settings.xml file

We suggest you use Eclipse with the ADT plugin to work this project.

The source code of the app can be found in:
src/com/plancake/android/app

The Java API Kit (that has got a repository itself at https://github.com/plancake/official-api-kit-java) can be found in:
src/com/plancake/api/client
